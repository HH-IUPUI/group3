    <p>Higher Education Institutions recognize intercultural competence as an area needing development for modern students, given the increase in globalized economies and workforces (Peifer, Chambers, & Lee, 2017). Creating global classrooms encourages students to engage in authentic problem solving and think about the views and values they hold, their community holds, and the world as a whole holds (Riel, 1994). Through our global collaboration, we had stumbling blocks that we had to work together to creatively solve. </p> 
	<p>Our first roadblock involved basic scheduling, which can be difficult logistically in any collaborative environment irregardless of distance. Throwing a six to seven hour time difference with varying career, course, and personal responsibilities made scheduling meetings times a delicate dance. Daylight savings time was another hurdle to our scheduling that we had to face. Students in the United States “Sprung Forward” on March 14 changing our time difference from seven hours to six hours. We did not anticipate the second Daylight Savings change when scheduling our meetings after March 28 to allow for the hour time change that happened in Finland. This caused confusing in our agreed upon meeting time and our actual meeting time. Through strong communication practices, we were able to easily navigate through these issues but they created interesting stumbling blocks. </p>
	<p>Without technology, our collaboration would not be possible but technology has occasionally been an impediment also. Zoom account with basic credentials was our first technological challenge due to its max of 30 minute meeting time frames and lack of repeating zoom links. This put a time restraint on our group and created an issue of ensuring everyone is in the correct zoom link. Internet speed and capabilities, causing slow speeds with glitching audio and visual, during zoom meetings occasionally impeded our ability to effectively communicate and caused frustration. </p>
	<p>Slack was another digital platform used for collaboration but the free subscription only lasted for the first couple of weeks of the coursework. Our subscription did get taken care of, but in order to keep momentum going without fear of losing our collaborative space we sought other messaging and document share platforms that remain free. </p>
